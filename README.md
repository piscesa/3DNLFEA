The aim for this project is to develop three-dimensional non-linear finite element analysis for reinforced concrete structures. The project was initially started in 2014. The project is now under heavy development to improve the efficiency in the computation, as well as the stability of the program. The program is written in C# with .Net 4.6.2 platform. Several external library such as Intel MKL, Cloo.Net and ManagedCuda are used by the program. Up-to-date, the program is able to handle up to 100,000 hexahedral element using a computer with at least had 16 GB memory.

# Pre and Post Processor
The program is prepared to use SALOME for both the pre and post processor.
