The aim for this project is to develop three-dimensional non-linear finite element analysis for reinforced concrete structures. The project was initially started in 2014. The project is now under heavy development to improve the efficiency in the computation, as well as the stability of the program. The program is written in C# with .Net 4.6.2 platform. Several external library such as Intel MKL, Cloo.Net and ManagedCuda were integrated into the program. Up-to-date, the program is able to handle up to 100,000 hexahedral element using a computer with 16 GB memory.

# Pre and Post Processor
The program is prepared to use SALOME for both the pre and post processor.

# Supported Element
- 8-noded hexahedral element [Full (8,27 GP),Reduced (1 GP) and Selective (BBar-Element) Integrations are supported]
- 20-noded hexahedral element  [Full (27 GP) and Reduced (8 GP) integrations are supported]
- 2-noded discrete truss element
- 2-noded embedded truss element [At the moment, only work with 8-Noded hexahedral element]

# Supported Constitutive Model
- Von-Misses (J2-Plasticity) with elastic-perfectly plastic material behavior.
- Von-Misses (J2-Plasticity) with hardening or softening parameter.
- Rankine-Fracture plasticity model with size dependent softening function.
- Papanikolau et. al. plasticity model [2007].
